Requirements
------------

 * SX package version 1.0.1 or greater
 * Python 2.6 or 2.7
 * CentOS 6, 7 or Debian Jessie

Upgrade instructions for CentOS
-------------------------------

 # tar xf sxauthd*.tar.gz && cd sxauthd*
 # ./sxauthd_upgrade.sh /srv/sxauthd
 # killall -s INT uwsgi
 # chkconfig saslauthd on
 # chkconfig --add sxauthd
 # service sxauthd restart

Installation instructions
-------------------------

 Perform the steps below on all SX cluster nodes.

 Unpack sxauthd:
 # tar xf sxauthd*.tar.gz && cd sxauthd*

 Upgrade SX and install dependencies.

     On CentOS:
     # cp skylable-centos.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/skylable.repo
     # yum install -y epel-release && yum install -y skylable-sx python-pip python-setuptools python-virtualenv cyrus-sasl gcc

     On Debian/Ubuntu:
     # cp skylable-debian.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/skylable.list
     # apt-key add GPG-KEY-skylable.asc
     # apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends sx python-dev python-virtualenv sasl2-bin gcc

     On Debian Jessie additionally:
     # apt-get install -y virtualenv

 If you upgraded from an earlier version of SX then run sxsetup --upgrade
 on each node, according to section 2.4 of the User Manual (manual.pdf),
 also available online at: http://www.skylable.com/products/sx/manual

 Install and configure sxauthd:

 # ./sxauthd_setup.sh /srv/sxauthd

 sxauthd requires a working saslauthd daemon to authenticate users, a minimal
 LDAP configuration is created in /etc/saslauthd.conf.
 Customize this according to /usr/share/doc/cyrus-sasl*/LDAP_SASLAUTHD*

 Enable services to start on boot:
     On CentOS:
     # chkconfig saslauthd on
     # chkconfig --add sxauthd

     On Debian:
     Edit /etc/default/saslauthd and set 'START=yes'
     # update-rc.d sxauthd defaults
     # adduser www-data sasl

 It is recommended that you have a syslog daemon running because
 uwsgi/sxauthd logs messages through syslog.

 (Re)start services:
 # service saslauthd start
 # service sxauthd start
 # service sxserver restart (service sx restart on Debian)

How to use
----------

Install the latest version of SXDrive from http://www.skylable.com/download/#sxdrive.

Perform these steps once:
 * right click the tray icon of SXDrive and select Settings
 * on the Account settings page click 'Start Wizard':
   * Click 'I have company credentials'
   * Server: yourcluster.example.com
   * Login: your LDAP uid
   * Password: your LDAP password
   * Device name: autofilled, but editable description of device
   * Click Next
   * On the popup verify the SSL certificate and click 'Yes'
   * Choose the (single) volume in the list and click Next
   * Choose a local directory to synchronize and press Next
   * Press Finish
   * all the settings fields should be filled based on the (newly created) cluster user

One-time setup for mobile device:
 * end-user opens https://yourcluster.example.com/.auth/web in the mobile browser.
 * enter your username (LDAP uid) and LDAP password
 * press login
 * customize the device name if needed
 * press create
 * the user is redirected to SXDrive with an activation link that autoconfigures access to the cluster.

Note: the username or password is never saved on the device.

What sxauthd does under the hood:
 * validate the username/password using saslauthd 
 * create a volume for the username, if it doesn't exist already
 * create a secret key for the provided username and device name
 * redirect the user with a device-specific link

The secret key can be revoked by the admin independently for each device
using sxacl. All devices get access to the same volume.

Example output of sxacl after logging in from two devices:
$ sxacl userlist --clone=u:test1 sx://sx.example.com
u:test1                  (normal) - test1
d:+ET057GiXiCrhLJrHRaZPQ (normal) - My Device (clone of 'u:test1')
d:Re5swjuEWWCLjvSejJbLRw (normal) - Android (clone of 'u:test1')
