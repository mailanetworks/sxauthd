# LDAP/PAM authentication for SX

Run `./dist.sh`: it will create an `sxauthd-0.5.tar.gz` archive which contains:
 * a README with installation instructions
 * an auto-install script (sxauthd_setup.sh)

There is also a `./run.sh` that can be used to test it locally using Docker.

sxauthd is distributed under the [BSD](LICENSE.md) license.
